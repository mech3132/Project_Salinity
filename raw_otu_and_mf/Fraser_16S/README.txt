The folder "MANUAL FILES" are files that should be generated manually.
Currently, this includes:
- the raw OTU table in biom format
- the raw mapping file

The folder “OUTPUT_FILES” holds the updated otu tables and mapping files needed for downstream analyses


*** The mf is manually changed
there is one case where the salinity for DU is not a single salinity; changed this
Also, I believe there are some file names for FN that are inconsistent?

I also manually added a 2 columns for control testing: one says “control:y” and another “all:y”

Finally, I changed the 1-6-19 st and 3-5-27 samples to be included; for some reason they were removeda long time ago, but they look normal to me
There are 3 samples from my 16S dataset that don't fall with each other so I excluded these.
"E-TB-2016-2","E-BA-2016-3","E-BL-2016-1"
